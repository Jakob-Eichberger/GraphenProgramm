# Graphen Programm
GraphenProgramm is a program that was developed during the first year of my education at the higher technical college [HTL Spengergasse](https://www.spengergasse.at/). The task was to develop a program that could perform operations on a graph without the use of external libs. In the program, the graph is represented as an adjacency matrix.
